Installation
--------------

To use it add following line to your composer.json:

    "require": {
        ...
        "deralex/yaml-config-service-provider": "1.0.x-dev"
        ...
    }


Usage
--------------
Include following line of code somewhere in your initial Silex file (index.php or whatever):

    $app->register(new DerAlex\Pimple\YamlConfigServiceProvider(PATH_TO_CONFIG));

Now you have access to all of your configuration variables through `$app['config']`.


Example
---------------

config.yml:

    debug: true
    imports:
        databases:
            resource: 'databases.yml'

databases.yml:

    database:
        mysql:
            host: localhost
            user: mysql
            password: mypassword
        postgresql:
            name: postgre
            host: localhost
            user: psql
            password: mypassword

index.php:

    <?php
        require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

        $app = new Silex\Application();

        // Considering the config.yml and databases.yml files are in the same directory as index.php
        $app->register(new DerAlex\Pimple\YamlConfigServiceProvider('config.yml'));

        if ($app['config']['debug']) {
            echo $app['config']['database']['mysql']['host'];
        }
        ...
